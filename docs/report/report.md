## Modeling of the search problem

The modeling consist of multiple parts which help us to mathematically understand the problem we are facing, it is composed by:
- Space state: Set of all the states composing the problem
- Initial state: It is a deffinition of the starting point of our situation
- Operator/Action function: Inside a search problem, this are functions describing how the subject can move from one state to another inside the space state
- Goal state: Particular state representing the objective of the problem, it is the state we want to reach
- Path cost: Each action requires a cost to pay, the objective of the search problem is to reach the goal state from the initial state having the smallest possible cost
Our modelation of the system
- Space state: S = {(i,j) \ i \in [0, W-1], j \in [0, H-1], $\\Psi$ * <= Tolerance}
- Initial state: \$S_0\$ = (\$i_0\$, \$j_0\$) | $\\Psi$ *  (i, j) <= Tolerance
- Goal: G = {\$p_1\$, \$p_2\$, \$p_3\$, ..., \$p_n\$} | n \in \$\mathbb{N}\$. \$s_goal\$ = \$p_i+1\$ = (\$i_goal\$, \$j_goal\$) \in S
